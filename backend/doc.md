Writer Project: A Question Answering System using Embeddings
This project implements a question-answering system leveraging text embeddings for efficient information retrieval. It's designed to find the most relevant paragraphs within a given text corpus in response to a user's question.

Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure, separating concerns into distinct components:

backend/QA_box/: Contains the core question-answering logic.

qa_utils.py: Functions for finding the most related paragraphs to a given question.
main.py: Entry point for the backend, handling question processing and response generation.
backend/ai_utils/: Provides utility functions and classes.

embedding.py: Handles text embedding generation using OpenAI's API. Includes classes for managing chunks of text and their embeddings.
available_models.py: Defines available embedding models and their configurations.
requirements.txt: Lists project dependencies (e.g., openai, scipy, tenacity, tiktoken).

Key Components
EmbeddingText Class (embedding.py): This class is responsible for:

Dividing large texts into smaller, manageable chunks.
Generating embeddings for each chunk using the OpenAI API.
Managing the relationship between text chunks and their corresponding embeddings.
EmbeddedChunk Class (embedding.py): Represents a single chunk of text along with its embedding and source information.

most_related_paragraphs Function (qa_utils.py): Takes a question and a list of EmbeddedChunk objects as input. It calculates the cosine similarity between the question's embedding and the embedding of each chunk, returning the top N most related paragraphs.

Error Handling and Retries: The code incorporates retry mechanisms to handle potential failures during API calls.

Usage
Install Dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the required packages listed in requirements.txt.

t your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).

Run the Backend: Execute main.py to start the question-answering system. This will likely involve loading a corpus of text, generating embeddings, and then waiting for user input or requests.

(Optional) Frontend Integration: A frontend could be added to provide a user interface for interacting with the system.

Future Improvements
Database Integration: For larger datasets, integrate a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store and manage text and embeddings efficiently.

Asynchronous Processing: Use asynchronous programming to improve performance and responsiveness, especially for embedding generation.

Caching: Implement caching to reduce redundant embedding computations.

Advanced Question Answering: Integrate a language model to generate more comprehensive and contextually relevant answers based on the retrieved paragraphs.
